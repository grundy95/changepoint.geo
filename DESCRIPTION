Description: Implements the high-dimensional changepoint detection method GeomCP and the related mappings used for changepoint detection. These methods view the changepoint problem from a geometrical viewpoint and aim to extract relevant geometrical features in order to detect changepoints. The geomcp(), function should be your first point of call.
